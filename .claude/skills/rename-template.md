description: Rename the template from `hono-mono-starter` and `@hono-mono-starter/*` to a new project name. Use right after the user clones/degits the template ("rename this to <my-app>", "I just made a new project from this template, change the names").

# Rename the template

The string `hono-mono-starter` (and `@hono-mono-starter/*`) appears in several places. After renaming, run `pnpm install` to update the lockfile, then verify with `pnpm typecheck`.

## Steps

1. **Ask the user for the new name** (kebab-case, npm-safe). Call it `<NEW>` below. Examples: `my-app`, `acme-platform`. The scope `@<NEW>/*` will be used for workspace packages.

2. **Rewrite package names and references.** Use Edit / replace_all on these files:

   | File | What to change |
   |------|-----------------|
   | `package.json` | `"name": "hono-mono-starter"` → `"name": "<NEW>"` |
   | `apps/server/package.json` | `"name": "@hono-mono-starter/server"` → `"name": "@<NEW>/server"` |
   | `apps/client/package.json` | `"name": "@hono-mono-starter/client"` → `"name": "@<NEW>/client"` |
   | Root `package.json` scripts | every `--filter @hono-mono-starter/...` → `--filter @<NEW>/...` |
   | `apps/server/src/app.ts` | `title: 'Hono Mono Starter API'` → `'<Display Name> API'` |
   | `apps/server/src/generate-spec.ts` | same title change |
   | `apps/client/index.html` | `<title>Hono Mono Starter</title>` → `<title><Display Name></title>` |
   | `apps/client/src/layouts/auth-layout.tsx` | `Hono Mono Starter` brand string |
   | `apps/client/src/layouts/app-layout.tsx` | `Hono Mono Starter` brand string |
   | `README.md` | top heading + every `@hono-mono-starter/*` reference |
   | `CLAUDE.md` | every `@hono-mono-starter/*` reference |
   | `.claude/settings.json` | `Bash(pnpm --filter @hono-mono-starter/* …)` patterns |
   | `.claude/skills/*.md` | every `@hono-mono-starter/*` and `hono-mono-starter` mention |

3. **Search for stragglers:**
   ```bash
   grep -rn 'hono-mono-starter' --include='*.ts' --include='*.tsx' --include='*.json' --include='*.md' --include='*.html' --include='*.js' .
   ```
   Anything left that isn't in `node_modules`, `dist`, `.git/`, or `pnpm-lock.yaml` should be hand-checked.

4. **Refresh the lockfile:** `pnpm install`. This rewrites `pnpm-lock.yaml` with the new names.

5. **Sanity-check:** `pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint`. If lint fails on the rename alone, the new name probably has a typo.

6. **Tell the user** what changed and that they should commit the rename as a single commit before doing other work.

## Notes

- This skill is one-shot. After running it once successfully, future Claude sessions don't need it again — the template names are gone.
- Don't rename folder paths like `apps/server` and `apps/client`. Tooling assumes them.
- Don't change the SQLite filename (`data.db`). To change dev ports, edit the root `.env` (`SERVER_PORT`, `CLIENT_PORT`, and the matching `SERVER_URL` / `CLIENT_URL`) — the server, Vite proxy, and CORS all read from there.
